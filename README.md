# Dotfiles

This repo consists of several config files (dotfiles) and scripts that are used to setup a new host to a ready state. This can be used on either a remote host (so that it has all my favorite configs) or a new personal computer. Currently it contains:

- Installer scripts
- Nvim configs
- Bash/zsh configs
- Bookmarks
etc.

Notice that the content may change without notice, due to my always-changing needs and wants. Make your own fork if you want to use it.
